            "clay_desc": "Small particles, high water retention. Can become waterlogged. Rich in nutrients. Suitable for crops that thrive in wet conditions like rice."

            "urea_desc": "What it is: A fertilizer that has a lot of nitrogen (46%). Why helpful: Nitrogen helps plants grow fast, makes them green, and increases leaf and stem growth. Note: If not managed well, some nitrogen can escape into the air or water, so farmers need to use it carefully.",
            "dap_desc": "What it is: Fertilizer that gives both nitrogen (18%) and phosphorus (46%). Why helpful: Nitrogen = growth and greenness. Phosphorus = strong roots, better flowers, and fruits. It dissolves quickly, so plants can use it fast.",
            "mop_desc": "What it is: Also called Potassium Chloride, with 60–62% potassium. Why helpful: Potassium makes plants strong, improves resistance to drought and disease, and helps in fruit/seed development. Not good for: Crops sensitive to chloride (like tobacco, grapes).",
            "ssp_desc": "What it is: An old but still useful fertilizer with 16% phosphorus, 19% calcium, and 12% sulfur. Why helpful: Phosphorus → root growth. Calcium → strong cell walls. Sulfur → better quality of oilseeds and pulses. Very good for soils lacking sulfur.",
            "npk_desc": "What it is: A mix of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in different ratios (like 10-26-26). Why helpful: Gives a balanced diet to plants— N = growth, P = roots & flowers, K = strength & disease resistance. Farmers choose the ratio depending on crop needs.",
            "ammonium_sulphate_desc": "What it is: Fertilizer with 21% nitrogen + lots of sulfur. Why helpful: Nitrogen = plant growth. Sulfur = improves taste, quality, and oil content in crops. Useful for crops like onion, garlic, and oilseeds."
