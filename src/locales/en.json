The region is already reeling with incessant rain and a flood-like situation.\nAccording to weather officials, the intense rainfall is likely to cause flooding and mudslides in hilly catchment areas, leading to severe waterlogging in low-lying urban areas.\nThe department also cautioned people that weak or vulnerable structures could be damaged by the volume and force of the rain.\n\n<h4>Orange alert in parts of Punjab, Haryana</h4>An orange alert has been announced for north and west Punjab, as well as north and south Haryana, from Saturday, indicating the likelihood of heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places.\n\nAn alert has been issued in the Kapurthala district by the administration appealing to people in the Sultanpur Lodhi area to move to safer places in view of the further increase in water level in the Beas river following incessant rains, officials said.\n\nSeveral Punjab districts, including Pathankot, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Amritsar, Ferozepur, Fazilka, Sangrur, Mansa and Moga, have recorded rainfall far above normal this monsoon season.\n\nFrom August 25, these regions experienced nearly eight to nine times the average rainfall, exacerbating the flood situation in low-lying areas.\n\nPunjab is facing floods with the Sutlej, Beas and Ravi rivers overflowing due to heavy rain in their catchment areas in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.",
